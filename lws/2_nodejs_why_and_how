node js is nothing but runtime for js.
chrome v8 runs on browser context which provides window and dom.
nodejs runs on server os context.

Thread/EventLoop:
node js is single threaded and non blocking io. It is not suitable for cpu intensive task. Though it is
single treaded it utilizes LIBUV library which works with kernel thread and provides working thread to 
handle reqeust. response is returned via callback mechanism aka asynchronous.
